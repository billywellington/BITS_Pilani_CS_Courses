# üìù Practice Questions on Arrays, Pointers, and Dynamic Memory Allocation

## 1. Easy Practice

**Write a program that:**

- Allocates memory for an array of **10 integers**.
- Fills the array with the numbers **10 to 19**.
- Prints each number using **pointer arithmetic** (not array indexing).
- Frees the memory at the end.

---

## 2. Medium Practice

**Write a program that:**

- Asks the user how many numbers they want to enter.
- Dynamically allocates memory for that many numbers.
- Asks the user to **enter each number** (use `scanf` inside a loop).
- After all numbers are entered, **print the sum** of all numbers.
- Free the memory when done.

## 3. Challenge Practice

**Write a program that:**

- Asks the user how many integers they want.
- Allocates memory for that many integers.
- Lets the user **enter** the integers.
- **Finds the maximum number** in the array using **pointer arithmetic only** (no `arr[i]` allowed).
- Prints the maximum number.
- Frees the memory at the end.
